    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>My theme for this project is about packing a bag lunch and eating it during my lunch break. I chose this theme because I stuck with my peanut butter and jelly sandwich theme because for some reason it helps me to think of coding like I am preparing a meal.</p>
<p>I did have to alter my original story in my discussion post, as well as my story from Project 1 so that it fits with this project a bit better.</p>
