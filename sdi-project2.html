<p>My theme for this project is about making and eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and the decisions I need to make in order to be satisfied. I chose this theme because I still love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and make them all the time, even though I am 24 years old. When I first saw the flow chart, I immediately thought of it as a recipe or cooking instructions, and it all started to make sense!</p>
<p>Everyone should be familiar with the peanut butter and jelly sandwich, so I don't need to tell you about how good it tastes or how easy it is to make. However, I will say that I had to alter my original story in my discussion post so that it fits with this project a bit better.</p>
