<p>I changed my theme for this project. This time, my story revolves around playing video games. I changed my theme because my previous one had me stumped. This was much easier to come up with ideas for the story, and I do enjoy video games too, so it was enjoyable.</p>
<p>For those that can't decipher my story, it is about a video game called Halo 3. It is a first person shooter type game, with a highly competitive multiplayer environment. It is also a lot of fun!</p>
